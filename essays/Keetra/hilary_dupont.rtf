\f0\fs28 \cf0 The themes I wanted to represent with my flags were change, evolution, and growth. The audience I chose to design my flags for are the RISD students, faculty and other visitors to College Hill. In a clich\'e9 way each flag can represent the four years of college, or the four seasons, but I\'92d rather think of them as simply the passage of time. I chose the color purple to symbolize pride and dignity, which I hope is something young student\'92s can gain through education. The shape slowly morphs from a square into a circle, ultimately separating from the flagpole. This shows the emergence of independence and self-reliance.}
