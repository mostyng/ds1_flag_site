\f0\fs24 \cf0 Flags I wanted to create flags that respected the context of the flagpoles they are meant to hang from. The yellow and blue are meant to be direct references to the Rhode Island State flags. The pink, white, and gradients are meant to visually signal that this was not made to be a replacement for the existing Rhode Island flag that is so often misremembered as the flag of Providence. I still tried to respect the area the flags would hang in by making visual references to things in Providence such as the canal and Waterfire.}
